This application retrieves data on what countries customers can send money to from
https://www.xoom.com/mapi/v2/countries
It also retrieves additional country-specific information from 
http://countryapi.gear.host/v1/Country/getCountries

Open the above APIs in https://jsoneditoronline.org/ to get a nice view of the json objects that they return.

The combined dataset is used to create a Goggle Charts world map visualization that highlights all of the countries that Xoom serves,
with the option of selecting each pin to get a birds-eye view of that country.
